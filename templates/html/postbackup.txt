        I was flying by myself on a 5+ hour flight to visit family over the holidays. I specifically booked and paid
        extra for an aisle seat in the second-to-last row because I have medical issues that sometimes require quick
        access to the bathroom.

        Right before boarding, a woman asked me to give up my seat so she could sit closer to the bathroom. She was
        pregnant but did not seem distressed. While I felt for her situation, as someone with a medical condition, I did
        not feel it was fair to demand I move from the seat I planned for and paid for, especially since she apparently
        had not booked an aisle seat herself in advance.

        The flight attendants refused to help mediate when she insisted I should have to move. There were also no other
        aisle or close seats available on the full flight that I or flight crew could facilitate swapping. I tried to
        recommend she speak to her doctor about needing accommodation if sitting far from the bathroom is not medically
        advisable for her situation during future flights.

        Still, my family says I should have inconvenienced myself and given up my seat. I disagree though - I think she
        and the flight crew were unfairly targeting me instead of handling it through proper channels. AITA?
